## Models

There are multiple models we could try and compare their performance.

### lgb_registration_num

This model uses several public data of one challenge, including number of registration.

### lgb_registration_detail

This model uses several public data of one challenge, including number of registration and registration details.


## AWS Sagemaker

In order to deploy the model in AWS Sagemaker, we need to create IAM role for running Sagamaker first.
